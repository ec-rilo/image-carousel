## Javascript, Webpack, and Linter Reinforcement
<p>HTML / CSS / JS / Webpack</p>

I practiced the use of javascript objects, module pattern, classes,and scopes. I also ran into some issues with webpack as I was initially creating this 
website like the program not compiling because I was missing something that the mini-css-extract-plugin required in order to let it function. I also 
used eslint and prettier in this project. Having to go back and solve some issues that they had since they did not play well.
